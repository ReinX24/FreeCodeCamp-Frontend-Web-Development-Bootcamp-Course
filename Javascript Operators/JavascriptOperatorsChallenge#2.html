            I would probably recommend using the second one because for me, just because they
            have the same value when the string is converted to a number does not mean that
            they are automatically equal to each other without any explicit conversion in the
            code.

            Answer: apparently there is no recommended method, both are valid. The real solution
            is to avoid comparing numbers and strings.
