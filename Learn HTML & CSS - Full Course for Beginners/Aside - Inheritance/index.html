    <h1><q>Dancing plague of 1518</q></h1>
    <h4>The Dancing Plague of 1518, or Dance Epidemic of 1518, was a case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg,
        Alsace (modern-day France), in the Holy Roman Empire from July 1518 to September 1518. Somewhere between 50 and
        400 people took to dancing for weeks.</h4>
    <h2>Events</h2>
    <p>The outbreak began in July 1518 when a woman named Frau Troffea began to dance fervently in a street in
        Strasbourg.[1] Troffea kept up the constant dancing for a week. Soon, three dozen others joined in.[4] By
        August, the "dancing plague" had claimed 400 victims.[4] Dancers were beginning to collapse. It is said some
        even died from a stroke or heart attack.[4] No one knew what caused this reaction, which meant no one understood
        how to remedy it. By early September, the outbreak began to subside,[5] when the dancers were sent to a mountain
        shrine to pray for absolution.[4]</p>
    <p>Historical documents, including "physician notes, cathedral sermons, local and regional chronicles, and even
        notes issued by the Strasbourg city council" are clear that the victims danced;[1] it is not known why.
        Historical sources agree that there was an outbreak of dancing after a single woman started dancing,[6] and the
        dancing did not seem to die down. It lasted for such a long time that it even attracted the attention of the
        authorities; until the council gave up authority to the physicians, who prescribed the afflicted to "dance
        themselves free of it."[3] There are claims that guild halls were refurbished to accommodate the dancing, as
        well as musicians and strong people to help keep those dealing with the dancing mania to stay upright.[3] This
        backfired, and the council was forced to ban public dancing as people danced in fear it was a punishment from
        Saint Vitus; and to be "free of sin" many joined in on the dancing epidemic.[3] The council went as far as to
        ban music, as well.[3] Those who danced were then ordered to go to the shrine of Saint Vitus, wore red shoes
        that were sprinkled with holy water and had painted crosses on the tops and soles.[3] They also had to hold
        small crosses in their hands; and incense and Latin incantations were part of this "ritual."[3] Apparently
        "forgiven by Vitus," word was spread of a successful ritual and the Dancing Plague had ended.[3]</p>
    <p>Events similar to this are said to have occurred throughout the medieval age including 11th century in KÃ¶lbigk,
        Saxony, where it was believed to be the result of demonic possession or divine judgment.[7] In 15th century
        Apulia, Italy,[8] a woman was bitten by a tarantula, the venom making her dance convulsively. The only way to
        cure the bite was to "shimmy" and to have the right sort of music available, which was an accepted remedy by
        scholars like Athanasius Kircher.[9]</p>

    <h2>Modern theories</h2>
    <h4>Food poisoning</h4>
    <p>Some believe[5] the dancing could have been brought on by food poisoning caused by the toxic and psychoactive
        chemical products of ergot fungi (ergotism), which grows commonly on grains (such as rye) used for baking bread.
        Ergotamine is the main psychoactive product of ergot fungi; it is structurally related to the drug lysergic acid
        diethylamide (LSD-25) and is the substance from which LSD-25 was originally synthesized. The same fungus has
        also been implicated in other major historical anomalies, including the Salem witch trials.[11][12]</p>
    <p>In The Lancet, John Waller argues that "this theory does not seem tenable, since it is unlikely that those
        poisoned by ergot could have danced for days at a time. Nor would so many people have reacted to its
        psychotropic chemicals in the same way. The ergotism theory also fails to explain why almost every outbreak
        occurred somewhere along the Rhine and Moselle rivers, areas linked by water but with quite different climates
        and crops".[2]</p>
