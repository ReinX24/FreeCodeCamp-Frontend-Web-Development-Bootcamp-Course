        // Challenge #1
        // 1. Create a boolean variable called `myBoolean` and set it to `true`
        const myBoolean = true;

        // 2. Create a string variable called `myString` and set it to `hello world`
        const myString = 'hello world';

        // 3. Create a number variable called `firstNumber` and set it to equal to `20`
        const firstNumber = 20;

        // 4. Create another variable called `secondNumber` and set it equal to `40`
        let secondNumber = 40; // we use let here since we re-assign it in #5ter

        // 5. Re-assign `secondNumber` and set it equal to 80
        secondNumber = 80;

        // 6. Create an array called `myArray` and put `myBoolean` at index 0, and `myString` at index 1
        const myArray = [myBoolean, myString];

        // 7. Create an object called `myObject` and assign `myArray` to a property called `firstProperty`, 
        // and the sum of `firstNumber` and `secondNumber` to a property called `sumProperty` (hint: we 
        // didn't cover how to do this here)
        const myObject = {
            firstProperty: myArray,
            sumProperty: firstNumber + secondNumber
        };

        // 8. Print `myObject` to the console
        console.log(myObject);

        // 9. Print the `sumProperty` of `myObject` to the console
        console.log(myObject.sumProperty);

        // 10. Print the value at index 1 of `firstProperty`
        console.log(myObject.firstProperty[1]);

        // Challenge #2
        /*
        There are three things wrong with this code.
        Fint them and explain why they are wrong.
        */

        // const some Number = 20; // this is wrong because there is a space within the variable name which throws an error
        // someNumber = 50 // this is not allowed because someNumber is a constant, assuming it was declared correctly, there also isnt a semi colon at the end

        // Challenge #3
        /*
        What does the value `resultVariable` equal? What data type is it?

        We haven't covered everything here in detail yet, but
        research this for a bit and see what you can find.
        */

        const variable1 = 20;
        const variable2 = '40';

        const resultVariable = variable1 + variable2; // "2040"
        console.log(resultVariable);
        // NOTE: when you add a String and a number together, they automatically result into a String

        // Challenge #4 
        /* 
        Why is this code invalid? Edit this until it is valid.
        */

        const objectVariable = {
            property1: 'i am property 1', // in the original these were semi-colons, the proper way of instantiating this is using a comma
            property2: 'i am property 2',
            property3: [20, 30, 40] // no comma needed for the last property
        };

        console.log(objectVariable.property3[2]); // prints 40

        // Challenge #5
        /* 
        Why does this code not work? Edit until it works.
        */

        const myNumArray = [20, 30, 50];
        // console.log(myNumArray[3]); // will not work because there is no element for index 3, returns undefined
